## Hi there 👋

I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from CEFET/RJ and I'm currently pursuing an M.Sc.     in Computational Modeling at LNCC.

🔬 Working with the [MARTIN Group](http://martin.lncc.br/), focusing on modeling and analyzing user behavior in supercomputing environments. My research interests include graph algorithms, graph modeling, complex networks, and interdisciplinary applications.

🏆 Former competitive programmer ([ICPCID](https://icpc.global/ICPCID/6B4WX3Z6N3EM)) and amateur chess player in my free time.
